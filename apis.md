description: Are the benefits of using carbon greater than the cost of climate change?
  To answer this question, an independent organization called DARA created a report
  in September, 2012 studying the economic costs of climate change. Much has been
  said about the moral, political, and social costs of Climate Change, but with Climate
  Change caused disease, droughts, storms, habitat changes and more theres a clear
  economic $$ cost as well.
